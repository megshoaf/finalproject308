      <h2><strong>How Plant Based Diets Influence the Environment</strong></h2>
      <p><br></br>Overall for environmental effets, swithcing to plant based diets help lower water and land use, decrease pollution and greenhouse gases, slow down deforestation and destruction of habitats, and help reduce destruction of topsoil.
      <br>Half of all the land that is habitatble on our Earth is utilized for agricultural purposes. About 30% of this is used for plant production, while the other 70% of land is used for animal production.</br>
      <br>29% of freshwater in the world is used for animal production and farming. The productions of one pound of <strong>beef</strong> uses 1800 gallons of water. Whereas to produce one pound of <strong>soybean</strong>, which is used to make plant protein like tofu, utilizes only 216 gallons of water.
      <br>Animal production and agriculture attrivutes for almost 15% of all global greenhouse gas emissions. This is a higher percentage than all global transportation combined.</br>
      <br>Below is linked are two calculators that you are able to use and input your information of how long you have been either vegetarian or vegan. For the <strong>vegetarian</strong> calculations, it will present you with, on average, how many animals you have not eaten, amount of CO2 emissions you kept out of the air, and how many pounds of meat you have not eaten. For the <strong>vegan</strong> calculator, you will be presented with how many gallons of water, pounds of CO2, square feet of forest, pounds of grain, and animal lives you have contributed to saving.
    </br>

    <br>These tools are a great way to show you how much you have helped not only the animals but also the environment.</br>
